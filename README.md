# Cloud-DevOps---Setting-up-a-Web-App-and-IDE-in-the-Cloud
In the first project of this series, you will learn the basics of building a web app and IDE using Cloud9. This will lay the foundations for your DevOps work across the next six projects!
ðŸš€ Just wrapped up a rewarding project using AWS Cloud9 to kickstart a Java web application

1. Setting Up an IAM User

âœ… Create an IAM User: Started by creating a dedicated IAM user for this project. This ensures Iâ€™m following AWS best practices by not using the root user for everyday tasks.

âœ… Assign Permissions: Assigned necessary permissions to the IAM user to access AWS Cloud9 and other resources. This step is crucial for maintaining security and managing permissions effectively.



2. Launching a Cloud9 Environment

âœ… Open AWS Cloud9 Console: Navigated to the AWS Cloud9 console and launched a new Cloud9 IDE. This IDE is a game-changer as it allows you to write, run, and debug code directly in your browser.

âœ… Configure Environment: Set up the environment with the necessary configurations such as instance type and storage size to suit the project's needs.



3. Installing Apache Maven and Java

âœ… Install Java: Used the terminal in Cloud9 to install Java Development Kit (JDK). This is essential for compiling and running Java applications.

âœ… Install Maven: Installed Apache Maven, a powerful project management tool that is indispensable for Java development.



4. Setting Up a Basic Web App Structure with Maven

âœ… Create a Maven Project: Created a new Maven project which sets up a basic structure for a Java web application. Maven takes care of managing dependencies and building the project.



5. Highlight and Reflection

ðŸŒŸ Seamless Integration: The highlight for me was witnessing the seamless integration of tools like IAM, Cloud9, Maven, and Java. This allowed me to set up a robust development environment from scratch.  



ðŸš€ Ready to Dive In?

This project reaffirmed the power and efficiency of using AWS Cloud9 for rapid development. If youâ€™re looking to streamline your development process, I highly recommend giving AWS Cloud9 a try.
